                <p><strong>11.4       </strong><strong>Additional Rights.</strong>  Certain states and/or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental, consequential or certain other types of damages, so the exclusions set forth above may not apply to you.<strong></strong></p>
                <p><strong>12.           </strong><strong>Indemnification</strong></p>
                <p><strong>12.1       </strong><strong>By wontah, inc.</strong>  wontah, inc will defend at its expense any suit brought against you, and will pay any settlement wontah, inc makes or approves, or any damages finally awarded in such suit, insofar as such suit is based on a claim by any third party alleging that the Service misappropriates any trade secret recognized under the Uniform Trade Secrets Act or infringes any United States copyright.  If any portion of the Service becomes, or in wontah, inc’s opinion is likely to become, the subject of a claim of infringement, wontah, inc may, at wontah, inc’s option: (a) procure for you the right to continue using the Service; (b) replace the Service with non-infringing services which do not materially impair the functionality of the Service; (c) modify the Service so that it becomes non-infringing; or (d) terminate the Service and refund any fees actually paid by you to wontah, inc for the remainder of the License Term then in effect.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, wontah, inc shall have no obligation under this section or otherwise with respect to any infringement claim based upon (w) any use of the Service not in accordance with these Terms or the Documentation; (x) wontah, inc’s conformance to your specifications; (y) any use of the Service in combination with other products, equipment, software or Content not supplied by wontah, inc; or (z) any modification of the Service by any person other than wontah, inc or its authorized agents.  This subsection states your sole and exclusive remedy for infringement claims and actions.</p>
                <p><strong>12.2       </strong><strong>Procedure.</strong>  The indemnifying party’s obligations as set forth above are expressly conditioned upon each of the following: (a) the indemnified party shall promptly notify the indemnifying party in writing of any threatened or actual claim or suit; (b) the indemnifying party shall have sole control of the defense or settlement of any claim or suit; and (c) the indemnified party shall cooperate with the indemnifying party to facilitate the settlement or defense of any claim or suit.<strong></strong></p>
                <p><strong>13.           </strong><strong>Termination</strong></p>
                <p><strong>13.1       </strong><strong>Term.</strong>  These Terms will continue to apply until terminated by either you or wontah, inc as set forth below (the <strong>“Term”</strong>).</p>
                <p><strong>13.2       </strong><strong>Termination by You.  </strong>If you want to terminate your agreement with wontah, inc, you may do so by (a) notifying wontah, inc at any time; and (b) closing your account for the Service, where wontah, inc has made this option available to you.  Your notice should be sent, in writing, to wontah, inc’s address set forth below.</p>
                <p><strong>13.3       </strong><strong>Termination by wontah, inc.</strong>  wontah, inc may at any time terminate these Terms if (a) you or any of your Named Users have breached any provision of these Terms (or have acted in a manner that clearly shows you do not intend to, or are unable to, comply with these Terms); (b) wontah, inc is required to do so by law (for example, where the provision of the Site or Service to you is, or becomes, unlawful); (c) the provision of the Service to you by wontah, inc is, in wontah, inc’s opinion, no longer commercially viable; or (d) wontah, inc has elected to discontinue the Site or the Service (or any part thereof).</p>
                <p><strong>13.4       </strong><strong>Effect of Termination</strong>.  Termination of your account includes: (a) removal of access to all offerings within the Service; (b) deletion of your password and all related information; and (c) barring of further use of the Service.  Upon expiration or termination, you shall promptly discontinue use of the Site and the Service.  However, Sections 5.6 (IP Ownership), 6 (Payment), 7.1 (License; Warranty), 7.4 (Content Loss), 8 (Third Party Links), 11 (Limited Warranty and Disclaimer), 12 (Limitation of Liability), 13 (Indemnification), 14 (Termination) and 15 (Miscellaneous) of these Terms will survive any termination of the Terms.<strong></strong></p>
                <p><strong>14.          </strong><strong>User Disputes.  </strong>Your interactions with other Users found on or through the Service are solely between you and such other Users.<strong>  </strong>If there is a dispute between you and any third party (including, without limitation, any User), wontah, inc is under no obligation to become involved; however, we reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor disputes between you and other Users.<strong></strong></p>
                <p><strong>15.           </strong><strong>Miscellaneous</strong></p>
                <p><strong>15.1       </strong><strong>Governing Law.</strong>  To the fullest extent permitted by law, and except as explicitly provided otherwise, these Terms and any disputes arising out of or relating to it will be governed by the laws of the state of California, in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act, without giving effect to any principles that provide for the application of the law of any other jurisdiction.  The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to these Terms. The laws of the jurisdiction where you are located may be different from California law.  You shall always comply with all international and domestic laws, ordinances, regulations, and statutes that are applicable to your purchase and use of the Service hereunder.</p>
                <p><strong>15.2       </strong><strong>Arbitration.  </strong>If you and we have a disagreement related to the Service or the validity of these Terms, we’ll try to resolve it by talking with each other. If we can’t resolve it that way, we both agree to use confidential binding arbitration, not lawsuits (except for small claims court cases) to resolve the dispute. We agree that any controversy or claim between us will be settled by one neutral arbitrator before the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). There’s no judge or jury in arbitration, arbitration procedures are simpler and more limited than rules applicable in court, and review is limited. But you are entitled to a hearing and the arbitrator’s decisions are as enforceable as any court order.</p>
                <p><strong>(a)          </strong>Arbitration shall be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act and not any state arbitration law. As modified by these terms of conditions of use, the arbitration will be governed by the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules and, if the arbitrator deems them applicable, the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively “<strong>Rules and Procedures</strong>”).  We further agree that: (i) the arbitration shall be held at a location determined by AAA pursuant to the Rules and Procedures (provided that such location is reasonably convenient for you), or at such other location as may be mutually agreed upon by you and us; (ii) any claims brought by you or us must be brought in our individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding; (iii) the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding; (iv) in the event that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to costs of litigation, we will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared to the cost of litigation; (v) we also reserve the right in our sole and exclusive discretion to assume responsibility for all of the costs of the arbitration; (vi) the arbitrator shall honor claims of privilege and privacy recognized at law; and (g) a decision by the arbitrator (including any finding of fact and/or conclusion of law) against either you or us shall be confidential unless otherwise required to be disclosed by law or by any administrative body.</p>
                <p><strong>(b)          </strong>With the exception of subparts (ii) and (iii) in the paragraph above (prohibiting arbitration on a class or collective basis), if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Rules and Procedures, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained in these terms of conditions of use. If, however, either subpart (ii) or (iii) is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, and neither your or we shall be entitled to arbitration, and the provision below titled “Forum and Jurisdiction” will apply.</p>
                <p><strong>(c)          </strong>For more information on AAA, its Rules and Procedures, and how to file an arbitration claim, you may call AAA at 800-778-7879, write the AAA at 1633 Broadway, 10th Floor, New York, New York 10019, or visit the AAA website at http://www.adr.org.</p>
                <p><strong>15.3       </strong><strong>Forum and Jurisdiction: </strong>You and wontah, inc agree that (i) claims for infringement or misappropriation of the other party’s patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret (including injunctive remedies or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief for asserted violation or threatened violation of intellectual property rights), (ii) claims for interim equitable relief in court in order to maintain the status quo pending the arbitrator’s ruling, and (iii) if this subparts (ii) and (iii) in Section 15.2(a) are held unenforceable or any claims, demands, or disputes are initiated, filed, or proceed in court rather than in arbitration for whatever reason, such claims, demands, or disputes shall be exclusively resolved by an appropriate federal or state court located in the County of San Mateo, California. You and wontah, inc agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located in the County of San Mateo, California for such purpose.</p>
                <p><strong>15.4       </strong><strong>Export.</strong>  You agree not to export, reexport, or transfer, directly or indirectly, any U.S. technical data acquired from wontah, inc, or any products utilizing such data, in violation of the United States export laws or regulations.</p>
                <p><strong>15.5       </strong><strong>Severability.  </strong>If any provision of these Terms is, for any reason, held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of these Terms will remain enforceable and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you agree that Section 12 (Limitation of Liability) will remain in effect notwithstanding the unenforceability of any provision in Section 11 (Limited Warranty and Disclaimer).</p>
                <p><strong>15.6       </strong><strong>Waiver.</strong>  Any waiver or failure to enforce any provision of these Terms on one occasion will not be deemed a waiver of any other provision or of such provision on any other occasion.</p>
                <p><strong>15.7       </strong><strong>Release.  </strong>You hereby release and forever discharge us (and our officers, employees, agents, successors, and assigns) from, and hereby waive and relinquish, each and every past, present and future dispute, claim, controversy, demand, right, obligation, liability, action and cause of action of every kind and nature (including personal injuries, death, and property damage), that has arisen or arises directly or indirectly out of, or relates directly or indirectly to, any interactions with, or act or omission of, other Users.  If you are a California resident, you hereby waive California Civil Code Section 1542 in connection with the foregoing, which states: “a general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor.”</p>
                <p><strong>15.8       </strong><strong>Remedies.</strong>  The parties acknowledge that any actual or threatened breach of Section 5 (License Grant and Restrictions) will constitute immediate, irreparable harm to the non-breaching party for which monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy, and that injunctive relief is an appropriate remedy for such breach.  If any legal action is brought to enforce these Terms, the prevailing party will be entitled to receive its attorneys’ fees, court costs, and other collection expenses, in addition to any other relief it may receive.</p>
                <p><strong>15.9       </strong><strong>No Assignment</strong>.  You will not assign, subcontract, delegate, or otherwise transfer these Terms, or its rights and obligations herein, without obtaining the prior written consent of wontah inc, and any attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void; provided, however, that you may assign these Terms in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of all or substantially all of you assets, or other operation of law, without any consent of wontah, inc.  These Terms shall be binding upon the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.</p>
                <p><strong>15.10    </strong><strong>Force Majeure.</strong>  Any delay in the performance of any duties or obligations of either party (except the payment of money owed) will not be considered a breach of these Terms if such delay is caused by a labor dispute, shortage of materials, fire, earthquake, flood, or any other event beyond the control of such party, provided that such party uses reasonable efforts, under the circumstances, to notify the other party of the cause of such delay and to resume performance as soon as possible.</p>
                <p><strong>15.11    </strong><strong>Independent Contractors.</strong>  Your relationship to wontah, inc is that of an independent contractor, and neither party is an agent or partner of the other.  You will not have, and will not represent to any third party that you have, any authority to act on behalf of wontah, inc.</p>
                <p><strong>15.12    </strong><strong>Use of name and logo.  </strong>You hereby grant wontah the right to use your name and logo to identify you as a customer of wontah in materials promoting the Service. You may request that we cease further use of your name and logo in newly created materials at any time by submitting a written request via email to info<a href="mailto:sales@wontah.com">@cloud9ide.com</a>, requesting to be excluded from such materials.  wontah will use commercially reasonable efforts to honor such request within thirty (30) calendar days after wontah’s receipt of such request unless such request is received by wontah less than five (5) business days following the date you enter into these Terms, in which case such request will be effective immediately upon receipt by wontah.</p>
                <p><strong>15.13    </strong><strong>Notices.</strong>  You are responsible for updating your data to provide wontah, inc with your most current e-mail address.  In the event that the last e-mail address you have provided to wontah, inc is not valid, or for any reason is not capable of delivering to you any notices required by these Terms, wontah, inc’s dispatch of the e-mail containing such notice will nonetheless constitute effective notice of the changes described on the notice.  Any notice provided to wontah, inc pursuant to these Terms should be sent to info@cloud9ide.com.</p>
                <p><strong>15.14    </strong><strong>Entire Agreement</strong>. These Terms are the final, complete and exclusive agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matters hereof and supersede and merge all prior discussions between the parties with respect to such subject matters. No modification of or amendment to these Terms, or any waiver of any rights under these Terms, will be effective unless in writing.</p>
